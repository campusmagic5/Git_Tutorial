# 🧑‍💻 Git & GitHub Tutorial for College Students

Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide where you'll learn how to use **Git** and **GitHub** through two simple paths:

- **Path 1:** Start a project locally and push it to GitHub
- **Path 2:** Clone an existing GitHub repository and contribute to it

We'll also cover concepts like **branches**, **tags**, **resets**, and **merge conflicts**, explained in simple language with real-life analogies.

## 🌱 Real-Life Analogy: “Project Diary”

Think of Git as your **project diary** — it records every change you make.  
GitHub is your **online locker** — where you store, share, and collaborate on that diary.

---

## 🚀 Path 1: Create a Project Locally and Connect to GitHub

### 1. Create a Local Folder
```bash
mkdir my-college-project
cd my-college-project
```

### 2. Initialize Git
```bash
git init
```
> 🔍 *This starts your diary (Git tracking)*

### 3. Create a File
```bash
echo "My project begins!" > intro.txt
git status
```

### 4. Add the File
```bash
git add intro.txt
```
> 🗂️ *Staging = putting your work in the submission folder*

### 5. Commit the File
```bash
git commit -m "Added introduction"
```
> 📌 *You’ve saved a version of your work*

### 6. Create a GitHub Repo and Push Your Code

Go to GitHub → Create a new repo (without README) → Copy the repo link  
Then:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-college-project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
> ☁️ *Now your diary is saved in the online locker (GitHub)*

---

## 🌿 Create & Switch Branches / Delete Branch
```bash
git branch new-feature
git checkout new-feature
git branch -d new-feature
```
> 📄 *Like photocopying your diary to test new ideas*

---

## 🔀 Merge Branch Back to Main
```bash
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
```

---

## 🔁 Reset to Undo

### To unstage a file
```bash
git reset <filename>
```
### Soft Reset (undo commit but keep changes)
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### Hard Reset (undo commit and remove changes)
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

> 🧽 *Like erasing a diary page*

---

## 🏷️ Add Tags to Bookmark Versions
### 1. Lightweight Tag
Just a pointer to a commit (like a simple bookmark)

No extra info like message, tagger, or date
```bash
git tag v1.0
```
🔖 Just tags the latest commit silently

### 2. Annotated Tag ✅ (Most Common for Releases)
Includes tag name, message, creator, date

Stored as a full Git object — better for public releases
```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "First Release"
git push origin v1.0
```
📝 Adds a proper label and description to the commit
> 🔖 *Sticky note saying "This is Version 1.0!"*

---

## ⚔️ Resolve Merge Conflicts

### Example:
Both Team A and Team B edited the same file `teamwork.txt` on different branches.

When merging, Git will show:
```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
Team B worked here
=======
Team A worked here
>>>>>>> branch1
```

Choose the correct content, remove the markers, then:
```bash
git add teamwork.txt
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
```

---

## 🌐 Path 2: Clone an Existing GitHub Repo

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/awesome-repo.git
cd awesome-repo
```
> 📥 *You’ve borrowed someone’s diary to work on*

### 2. Make Changes & Push
```bash
echo "Updated section" >> report.txt
git add report.txt
git commit -m "Updated report"
git push origin main
```

---

## 🔧 Create Feature Branch and Pull Request
```bash
git checkout -b improve-layout
# make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Improved layout"
git push origin improve-layout
```
> Then go to GitHub and open a Pull Request.

---

## 🛠 Helpful Git Commands

- See commit history:
  ```bash
  git log --oneline
  ```

- Discard changes in a file:
  ```bash
  git checkout filename.txt
  ```

- View what changed:
  ```bash
  git diff
  ```

---

## 💡 Summary

- Git = Project diary
- GitHub = Online locker
- Commit = Save your work
- Branch = Try new things without messing up the main project
- Merge = Combine ideas
- Reset = Go back in time
- Tag = Bookmark a version
- Conflict = Two people wrote on the same page — fix it!
